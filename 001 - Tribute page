    <ul class="list">
        <br>
        <li>Ant√¥nio Francisco Lisboa born in Ouro Preto (Black Gold), Minas Gerais, Brazil, in <strong>1738 (or 1730)</strong>.</li>
        <li>He was the son of a Portuguese man and his African slave, altough he lived with his half siblings. Here he learned the fundamentals of sculpture and architecture.</li>
        <li>Initially he first worked as a day laborer working on the Crurch of Our Lady of Carmel in the town of Ouro Preto designed by his father. In a breaf he had become a noted architect and had designed and constructed the Chapel of the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi in Ouro Preto.</li>
        <li>In <strong>1777</strong> he began to show signs of a debilitating disease, probably leprosy or possibly scleroderma, and he received the name "o Aleijadinho", "The Little Cripple." Although disfigured and disabled, popular belief holds that he continued sculpting with a chisel and hammer tied to his fingerless hands.</li>
        <li>He died on <strong>November 18, 1814,</strong> and was buried in the Church of Our Lady of Conception of Antonio Dias under a wooden floor section with his name carved on it.</li>
